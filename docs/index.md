# Helping you navigate the AI revolution before you get left behind

Hi! I'm Dave, an entrepreneur and educator from the Netherlands. I work with technical professionals facing the overwhelming pace of AI innovation and businesses struggling to translate AI hype into competitive advantage. Whether you're a developer watching your skills becoming obsolete or a company unsure how to implement AI effectivelyâ€”the challenge is the same: how to effectively use this technology before your competitors do.

## About Me

My goal is to cut through the hype and make the complex world of data and AI accessible to everyone. My journey started in 2013 when I started studying artificial intelligence at VU Amsterdam. At that time, having never written a single line of code, I followed my natural intuition for building and optimizing things.

My artificial intelligence journey spans over a decade, with bachelor's and master's degrees in the field and experience building custom data and AI systems across utilities, government, and e-commerce sectors. My tech stack includes Python, PostgreSQL, ML, FastAPI, OpenAI, Claude, Azure, vector databases, RAG, and LLM integration for enterprise applications.

## Why work with me?

Here's what sets me apart and how I can help drive value for your business:
