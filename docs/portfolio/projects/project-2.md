# Enterprise Chatbot for the Company Y

Company Y an AI project featuring a private ChatGPT-like tool, streamlining mobility data analysis and advancing digital innovation in public sector policy evaluation.

## Challenge

The regional data team at Company Y faced the challenge of analyzing complex mobility data, including cars, bridges, traffic, and cyclists. Tasked with assessing policy compliance and the impact of changes, they struggled with data scattered across multiple systems, such as the Dexter portal's structured SQL data and various policy documents. This dispersion made analysis laborious, prompting the Province to explore how digitization and AI could streamline the process and foster innovation.

## Our Approach

To tackle this challenge, we developed a custom-built AI solution similar to a "private version of ChatGPT." This tool was designed to access and analyze large volumes of PDF documents and structured data exported from the Dexter database. By enabling a ChatGPT-like interaction, users could query this diverse data pool in a conversational manner, leveraging the AI to gain company-specific insights.

## Results & Impact

- Successfully integrated structured SQL data and unstructured PDF documents
- Featured in major company meetings
- Enabled conversational querying of complex mobility data
- Streamlined policy compliance assessment
- Enhanced decision-making through comprehensive data analysis
