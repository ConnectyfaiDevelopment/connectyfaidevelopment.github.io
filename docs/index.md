# About me

<div class="grid-container" markdown>

<div class="text-intro-grid" markdown>

Hi! I'm Dave, an entrepreneur and educator from the Netherlands. My goal is to cut through the hype and make the complex world of data and AI accessible to everyone. My journey started in 2013 when I started studying artificial intelligence at VU Amsterdam. At that time, having never written a single line of code, I followed my natural intuition for building and optimizing things.

Fast forward a decade and I'm still as excited as ever about programming, data, and algorithms, now also sharing my lessons and experiences online. This website is an attempt to document my ongoing journey in personal growth, entrepreneurship, and of course, artificial intelligence.
