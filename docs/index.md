## Frequently asked questions

??? note "How do you ensure AI projects don't fail like 80% of implementations?"
    My evaluation-first approach validates AI feasibility before major investment. We assess your data quality, integration requirements, and success metrics upfront. This methodology identifies potential issues early, ensures alignment with business goals, and creates a clear implementation roadmap that dramatically improves success rates.

??? note "What types of AI projects do you specialize in?"
    My expertise lays in implementing production-ready AI systems that integrate with existing business data and workflows. This includes RAG knowledge systems, customer support AI, educational assistants, and business process automation. My focus is always on solutions that deliver measurable ROI, not just impressive demos.

??? note "Do you work with clients who have little technical AI knowledge?"
    Absolutely. Many of my clients have limited technical AI expertise. I bridge the gap between business needs and technical implementation, explaining concepts in clear language and focusing on business outcomes rather than technical jargon. My goal is to empower you to make informed decisions without requiring deep technical knowledge.

??? note "How do you handle data security and confidentiality?"
    Data security is foundational to any system. I implement industry-standard encryption for all data transfers, sign comprehensive NDAs before accessing any information, and follow strict security protocols throughout the project lifecycle. I can seamlessly integrate with your existing security infrastructure or help establish appropriate safeguards for your AI systems.

??? note "What's your pricing structure?"
    I offer both project-based pricing and monthly retainers based on your needs. Project fees are determined by scope, complexity, and expected business impact rather than hours worked. For ongoing AI implementation and optimization, I provide flexible retainer packages. Let's discuss your specific requirements to determine the most effective approach.

??? note "How do you measure success for AI implementations?"
    Success is measured by the specific business metrics we establish during the evaluation phase. This might include reduced support costs, time saved, revenue generated, or other KPIs aligned with your business goals. I implement monitoring and observability frameworks that track these metrics continuously, ensuring you can clearly see the ROI of your AI investment.

??? note "How do you communicate progress and results?"
    I provide structured weekly updates with measurable progress metrics, host regular alignment meetings, and document all implementation decisions. My evaluation framework creates transparency throughout the process, ensuring you always understand where we are, what's next, and how it connects to your business goals.
