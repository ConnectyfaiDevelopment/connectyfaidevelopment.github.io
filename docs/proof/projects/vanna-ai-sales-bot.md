## The Pain Point (From data-rich to insight-poor)

The company had mountains of sales data, but frontline teams were flying blind. Simple questions like “Which SKUs haven’t sold in 30 days?” or “How much revenue did we drive via Nabis this month?” took days to answer. Every request went through analysts who were already stretched thin. This led to:

* Constant delays in pricing and promo decisions
* Sales teams wasting hours building reports instead of selling
* Missed revenue due to outdated product insights
* Executive frustration over low data leverage

The data existed—it just wasn’t accessible at the speed business demanded.

## Success Probability Transformation (From frustrating to frictionless)

Previous BI investments focused on dashboards that looked nice but required weeks of training. They didn’t scale to non-technical staff. Natura needed a different approach: get answers, not tools.

This time, the strategy flipped. Instead of starting with data structures, we started with the 30+ actual business questions decision-makers asked every week. We trained a natural language AI to map those to SQL.

The result? No learning curve. Just accurate answers in plain English. Trust soared as the system answered hard questions consistently, without errors or excuses.

## Implementation Speed Advantage (Results in weeks, not quarters)

From kickoff to production in under 30 days:

* **Week 1**: Connected live data via Google Sheets, cleaned with automated scripts
* **Week 2**: Built MVP chatbot with Claude 3.5 + ChromaDB + SQLite
* **Week 3-4**: Trained on schema, business logic, and real executive questions
* **Day 30**: Live with production data, deployed across departments

No vendor lock-in. No 6-month roadmap. Just immediate value.

## Seamless Business Integration (Answers where teams already work)

No app downloads. No new accounts. Just a web link.

* Teams asked questions directly during sales meetings
* Regional leads used it to analyze seasonal SKU performance
* Finance pulled real-time revenue breakdowns by brand, customer, or location
* No disruption to workflows—just faster answers

Adoption skyrocketed because the system fit how people already worked.

## Measured Business Success (Clear, company-wide impact)

* **80% drop in ad-hoc SQL/reporting requests**
* **Increased revenue from real-time product prioritization**
* **Faster churn detection via automated account health checks**
* **More productive sales meetings powered by live data**
* **Better forecasting from consistent, trusted answers**

Most importantly, it unlocked a data culture shift—now any team member could ask questions and get answers in seconds, not weeks.
