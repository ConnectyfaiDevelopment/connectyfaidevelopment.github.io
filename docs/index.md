# Helping you navigate the AI revolution before you get left behind

Hi! I'm Dave, an entrepreneur and educator from the Netherlands. I work with technical professionals facing the overwhelming pace of AI innovation and businesses struggling to translate AI hype into competitive advantage. Whether you're a developer watching your skills becoming obsolete or a company unsure how to implement AI effectively—the challenge is the same: how to effectively use this technology before your competitors do.

## About Me

My goal is to cut through the hype and make the complex world of data and AI accessible to everyone. My journey started in 2013 when I started studying artificial intelligence at VU Amsterdam. At that time, having never written a single line of code, I followed my natural intuition for building and optimizing things.

Since 2019, I've been building practical AI systems that solve real business problems. My approach cuts through the hype to focus on what actually works—systems that deliver measurable ROI while building on your existing infrastructure. When your competitors are chasing the latest buzzwords, my solutions give you the edge that matters.

My artificial intelligence journey spans over a decade, with bachelor's and master's degrees in the field and experience building custom data and AI systems across utilities, government, and e-commerce sectors. My tech stack includes Python, PostgreSQL, ML, FastAPI, OpenAI, Claude, Azure, vector databases, RAG, and LLM integration for enterprise applications.

## Things I'm working on

Here's an overview of the various initiatives I'm currently working on in the fields of AI, education, and entrepreneurship.
