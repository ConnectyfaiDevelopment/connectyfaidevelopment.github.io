!!! abstract "Case Study Summary"
    **Client**: Wijschool Foundation  
    **Website**: [wijschool.nl](https://wijschool.nl)  
    **Industry**: Education  
    
    **Impact Metrics**:
    
    - **Accuracy leap from 50% to 82%** in handling complex banking queries
    - **Hallucinations reduced by over 70%** in financial advice and account information
    - **Expansion from single pilot to multiple banking clients**
    - From concept to production in just 2 months
    - **100% compliance** with financial data security regulation

## The Critical Business Problem

A promising stealth fintech startup faced a make-or-break moment:

- Banking AI assistant showing only 50% accuracy in real customer scenarios
- Initial pilot bank considering termination of the partnership
- Hallucinations in financial advice creating potential regulatory concerns
- Leadership questioning product viability in financial services market

## Success Probability Reversal (From Likely Failure to 100% Success)

Instead of rushing more features or technical changes, I first implemented:

- Comprehensive evaluation framework mapping all failure points
- Systematic analysis of where the RAG pipeline broke down
- Client-specific testing suite with real banking queries
- Compliance validation protocol for every AI response

This assessment pinpointed exactly why the existing system failed where standard approaches couldn't identify the issues.

## Implementation Timeline Advantage (Weeks vs. Potential 6+ Month Rebuild)

The evaluation-driven approach delivered transformative results rapidly:

- Critical retrieval pipeline improvements implemented within 2 weeks
- First accuracy improvements visible in week 3
- Banking-specific guardrails completed by week 6
- Full production readiness achieved in 8 weeks total

## No Client Effort (Zero Disruption vs. Typical Pilot Restart)

The solution minimized implementation friction through:

- Zero changes required to banking systems
- No additional data requirements from client
- Maintaining existing API contracts and integrations
- Seamless transition without service interruption

## Verified Business Impact (Company-Saving Results)

The approach delivered exceptional return on their initial investment:

- 82% accuracy transformed failed pilot into expansion opportunity
- From imminent failure to multiple successful deployments
- 8-week turnaround vs. months of uncertain redevelopment
- Zero disruption to existing banking client relationships

Result: Company avoided pivot, secured additional funding, and expanded to multiple banking clients.
